default_duration=The default duration is applied to media that do not have an ending event. For example, Images and SWFs.  Some SWFs can can be tracked to a Frame number depending on the type.\r\n\r\nChanging the default duration will only affect newly created media, groups and channels. Current media will not be affected.
default_effect=An introduction transition can be applied to media media in a channel and/or group. Transitions can also be applied to media and text in an overlay.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, video cannot have an introduction effect because of the hardware acceleration.
